A yum plugin to exclude kmod packages from the yum transaction set which
require kernels that are not yet available.

Elrepo.org provide kmod packages for RHEL and compatible distros. RHEL point
releases sometimes break kABI compatibility requiring a rebuild of the kmod
package against the latest RHEL kernel.

When this occurs at a RHEL point release, compatible distros such as CentOS and
Scientific Linux often have yet to release their corresponding kernels which
causes unresolved dependancy errors in yum.

This plugin seeks to determine the kernel version that any given kmod package
is built against and then determine if the corresponding kernel is available.
If the corresponding kernel is not available, the kmod package will be excluded
from the yum transaction set until the required kernel becomes available.

Note: CentOS users will need to enable the CentOS Vault repositories to make
previous kernels available to yum otherwise older kmod packages may be excluded.
